**Files named like**: tinkoff1.go, tinkoff2.go are problems I solved for winter internship for Golang developer in tinkoff. It was actual exam that lasted 6 hours and I didn't solve fifth problem.

**Autumn Tinkoff contains**: screenshots with problems' description of Autumn exams. I didn't pass them because I had no skills back then. And also this folder contains solutions for five of those six problems. All solution were tested on big input values, tested in memory allocation and time limits. They all should successfully pass requirements of exam.
